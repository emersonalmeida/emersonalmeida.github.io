Options to Add pictures and watermarks on invoice templates 4. Option to 
delete customerSharabi love itI install this app without putting any information into it about my 
personal business within less than 60 seconds it was sending me an email. 
This app took my personal information from my phone and sent me an e-mail I

other people?

easiest, reliable and simple to use though it can still be improve. All in 
all great app!ExcellentGood apps..It is good appsHelpfullWhat a good simple app to help invoicingGood applicationAwesome app I love how simple yet efficient this app is. By far the best 
Invoice application I've used.You'd think finding a simple straightforward invoice app would be a doodle. 
Not so. Therefore it was a relief to discover "Invoice manager', easy to 
use with helpful features I hadn't expected. Recommended.Excellent, easy to use software. Love the web interface feature, use it at my office and use the mobile app on the go. I would however love it if you guys might add a stock control feature, on the back burner. Most importantly What I need is a job card section - just plain and simple - date booked in, description of the job, who it is assigned to. Besides that the software is fabulous - and the fact that there is only one package, makes it an obvious easy and affordable option.Just superb .... 1 thing is need to improve is privacy.. Update to secure 
with password .. And 2nd add Stoke management system That will better for 
customer in use of single app And sir after using 1 month i come to know 
that I can't see total selling of past month and received payment of past 
month..(it's showing in graf only) So add to that so we can see past 
transactions..So add for watch payment by month so we can compare ... ThanksVery helpful App.love itFantastic and practical application. Please add an expense manager and the 
ability to duplicate invoice. Thank you and keep up the terrific job!! 
............. I gave 5 Stars initially. I took one back because after the 
update it is not syncing. Keeps saying "syncing process failed. Please try 
again". This is bad. Please help.Good for billingGood app can you insert new feature in this application. like quotation

you.Very OKIts is good app but add one option which is purchase order and inventoryIt works fine and well.It's brilliant. The customers are very impressed getting the email on 
estimate and invoice before you leave there premises. Comment from client 
is very efficientBrilliant app !!! Please Adding More Invoice Theme!!Nice one guys..... This is real helping me for my business...Works great on the go for quick quotes, and at home it synced great with my 
printersangat mudah di gunakanNeed more improvement.Where i want to pay..i only can pay 7-e counterGreat APPIt's still goodGreat invoicing app 5 starsGreat appGreatGood as ever thought ofBest appIts not syncing properly, when I click sync, some of the data I just 
entered and saved dissappears, I added one payment and its show twice, and 
I can't delete the additional entry, if I click send, it duplicates the 
invoice, its changed the invoice number from the one I just saved, its 
showing my business Id as my tax id on the invoice, part of my address is 
cropped on the invoice preview, I have to say I'm really dissapointed so 
far with this app, If forced me to pay to see if all functions worked like 
I expected, namely not being able to backup data or syncing unless you are 
a paid subscriber, upon paying all the bugs of the system started, yes I'm 
testing it on 2 devices, doing updates on one and checking on the other, 
but between syncing there is a long time delay in updating, and not all the 
new data shows up on the other device, this is an invoicing system, how can 
anyone rely on a system that is meant to manage your invoices and payments 
if it has so many bugs and errors, imagine if you had 50 invoices, how 
would you even know if payments were paid or not?? suffice to say the 
monthly payment will be the last.....I'm totally dissapointed in the 
reliabilty of this app,GoodI want to purchase this app plz help meWorks great, does everything i need for my computer service work, plus the 
price is very reasonableGoodGreat App but my trial version over so can't enjoy this app.I hope bluetoot thermal paper receipt printing is available..Still trying it!Yes, this app is great, love itExellentIt's amazing, makes everything easier to produce.Great appGreat app for global clienteleFantastic app and awsm invoiceThanks for making my life easy. Just add more templates for the invoicesVery good user friendly appSimple invoice, you apso can put your logo. But you have to buy after trial.It turned our mom & pop landscaping business into a more professional and technically capable company. We went from carbon copies to online searchable invoices. Would love proposal capability and possibly you have it and I haven't looked. Either way Love it.Amazing!THIS APP IS EXCELLENT! THANK YOU!Nice app. But invoice will be generated to individual customers as well. Not always to organization. So here the problem comes. When 2 customers have same name them you can't generates invoice using it. I think this logic should be changed and come up with the solution. Otherwise 5* app.Best app I've tried in a long time thank you KentVery good applicationLove this, simple and easy to use. Very helpful. Thank you lNice one but your data store in cloud or server so I suggest data are secure in this app make new data storage  appAwesome, now if they only had an inventory app I would be set.Nice and very useful app...Great app,I love itOK app. Serves the basic purposeEasy to use,light weight and...

Improve import Export dataSeamless interface. So user friendlyThanks! I love this app. My old phone stopped working. Logged in on new 
phone, there's all my invoices! Nothing lost. App works great everytime!it used to work perfectly, then update 2.1 or whatever came along and it "broke"  now when send invoice it saves as draft to my gmail, have to send multiple times the same invoice for it to "complete" just once.  prior to update I only had to send ONCE and it sent it no problem, even if I were to mark as paid.  now it just will not send properly at all, I have tried removing and reinstalling it which has not helped at all.Awesome and helpfulThe only improvement that I suggest is that to add the abikity to tranager 
yout company data Nd invoices to a new deviceAwesome app.. I'm self employed and can send professional invoices at the 
end of the week in 5 minutes ..Good oneUsefull for me, thanksFantastic appNiceUseful little invoice generatorIt's amaInggreat app thanksGood oneGoodI have used multiple apps for invoicing but I love this super simple yet 
professional app because of the ease of use and simple directions. It's 
helped me send invoices quicker meaning I get paid quickly and that's 
everything in small business!! Super easy starter invoice app!! Love itGood app..but not sure is it absolutely free..still trying to use it!This app does everything I need. Easy to use, professional interface and 
customer service has resolved my questions quickly. It's free, which is 
amazing! Very happy customer!Best invoice app in play store...If you need a simple invoicing app with lots of features, this is it. Has 
everything i need and lots of flexability. Very impressed!Great app, help me a lot. Thanks üòäThis app doesnt take back up of your invoiceGreat invoice maker. Easy to use.Wonderful so far!Great app needs a few updates to make better (week view on account and 
being able to use sd card for storage as will use a lot of space in the 
long runLove it...just stuggle to sync it when you change account to another 
device..Why u want access to my pics and contacts I mean I almost didn't sign up 
cause of thatEasy to use, Amazing app, freelance LD needed something to do on the go.Absolutely brilliant app. Create invoices and estimates effortlessly.It's an awesome and very useful for my business, very lite very easy to use 
and it generates reports automatically.Very usefulSo far it's doing it's jobQuick and simple. Suits all my needs. But i feel it doesnt snyc between 
android and ios. I would give 5 stars if they can fix this issue.Good simple app.I don't understand why you need access to my photos, media, and files to 
use the app? Its an invoice app that exports to your email. I had this app 
on iPhone and loved it, but I don't know who you people are or what your 
using my data for in Hong Kong. Your privacy clause says you will retain my 
data for to sell to third party's for 24 and I must email you to have 
removed after the 24 months? China doesn't have the best reputation for 
reliability so sadly I will not use this app anymore..Has all that one might need for free and without ads. It could use more or 
even custom designs, but otherwise it's a basic yet powerful tool that does 
what it says.No syncing . On the email not reliable.i lost by phone tried te connect to 
my account from another phone .lost all my data base . Big issue really 
disappointedAwesomeThis app suits my tiny business. Very easy to use.Simple and very good. Strait fwdBest applicationSuper simple best everAwesomeApps is very straight forward and simple to use. Having slight problem in 
finding custom invoice template function, atleast allow to user to add in 
our logo will be very much thank you.Quick and simpleAwesome invoicing app. Thanks developersFantastic app I really like it it's been great for business it really makes 
me look more professional and gives security to my customersLovely app for on the go invoicing.SuperbAbsolutly love this app, and ive tried many before. Its very user friendly, 
without all the ads to get in the way.Best invoicing app I've ever usedGreat app for someone starting up in a small business.Wow had to email developers to make sure i wouldn't be charged later. 
Brilliant.. was getting cheesed off with other greedy developers asking for 
subscriptions...i do about 10 a day with this and its greatGood appGreat quick and easy to useGreat app for quick invoicingWorks goodSuch a fantastic tool. Business is very on the go these days and this fits my business pace. 5 stars well earnedIts very nice app and very useful for small business type. It could deserve 
5 star rating if some feature would be there like; adding shipping adress, 
phone number, shipping date etc..The app is good and i love it. But it sync to my ipad very slow. Please update the sync system.Love itGreat simple interface.. highly productiveSince installing this app onto my tablet after my phone broke it didnt allow me to access my account I saved synced info for so lost 142 invoices worth of data luckily there is a copy of each individual invoice in my sent emails... the worst issue I am having si ce installing it on my tablet is that once I mark my invoices as paid they stay in the outstanding section every invoice sits in there and it makes keeping track of things really hard please fix thisThe new version is.much far better then older versionDoes exactly what I wanted it to doLove it.My phone broke and I was able to restore all the info. It was very helpful. I was worried to loss all the invoices but no. The were all databaseNot badGreat app. I love that it doesn't charge a fee to use.Great appsGreat appGood apps, in the future please upgrade to be more modernisticGreat app quick and easy BUT........ Syncing between android and IOS never works probably and when it does it takes days,  not much help from the support team.Great app only flaw is it needs a sync button on the menu somewhere as it takes a day or two for my laptop to sync to my phoneDoesn't save the details and fails to display in invoice. Very basic functions are having bugs. Ignored android app and works good in iOS.If can add Additional signatures of both parties It w...

Cheers!Good free version. Not sure about the paid oneEverything you need in 1 app! Easy 2 use!Super easyVery easy to use.

I like that I can also add things like taxes, discounts and measurements.FF liveI really like this app so far.

so I know it has worked in the past, for an app that you pay good money for 
its very poor I'd expect this off a free one maybeNiceI can't open the app for several days now, thanks for taking my money. I 
guess y'all need it more than I do.Very usefulMost of the time it gives you that the connection with the server has 
problemThis for a mobile locksmith works great... Jim Key ProI have just started a brand new business and this app has really helped me 
out in quoting and invoicing. Highly recommended.Exactly what I was looking for! Very professional invoice maker.Great and easy invoice maker üí∞üìÑ‚õ±Ô∏è. Highly recommended! üëçüëåGreat business app and very simple usability!Great app. Had a minor issue but the support staff was very helpful to 
solve the issueVery simple to use. Can email directly from softwareTerrible support team as they never accept that there is a problem with 
their app.It makes things easy. But gosh! It could be a lot better. It freezes, it 
lags and crashes a lot!. Please work on more flexibility, it would be great 
if the edit allow you add an item in between your list and not just at the 
end for proper organization of your invoice. Sometimes I have to delete a 
lot of items just to add a new item. Thats not cool. ThanksTerribleGreat simple and straightforwardIt's a great tool but gets very slow if you build up multiple invoices.Customer service 100%Good! App but not so user friendly!! User interface is good, can make best app ... Data must be sorted üòáGood app. Invoices does not follow one another...?????üòïThe app keeps crashing what's going on, I've tried it on 2 VERY different cell phones(Apple & Android) and it will crash every 35 seconds no matter what...please fix it we have a company to run!Amazing app, easy to use and friendlyThis app does not work well with androidGood platform. App extremely glitch  currently does not allow me to send emails. The coded text for emails does not function properly and before when I could send emails they were forced to go through billdu servers I couldn't send from my own email. If these issues get fixed I would rate 5 stars.  Cannot uninstall and reinstall the email platform on this device as it is a default app.Waste of time and money. I lost all my invoices and the tech's answer to it was just to use a desktop. That is far from what I paid for and they were far from helpful aswell as being contradictory. Definitely would not recommend.  Edit 14/5/2017  I have done everything you have suggested.  Still no remedy.  Very Disappointed.Perfect for contractors on the road:) Love it. Simple, and easy to use. Very intereseting app which I recommend to everyone.Easy and fine In our business we li...

The most comprehensive invoicing package I\'ve come across. This has all the features I need. Easy to use and decent support if you have any questions.ExcellentInvoices look professional and clear to my customers. I also use it for sending estimates which looks really impressive to clients with my logo and company information on the PDF. I also use it to keep track of whose payments are overdue. It marks ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù on invoices when clients pay up. You also get info on who your best customers or products are, really helpful to analyse your business. I would definitely recommend. The web version is really slick as well.The app is quite good. But not being able to delete invoices and estimates sucks. Please work on that. It is close to impossible to renew the subscription. Keeps saying \'you already own this item\' when I try to renew my subscription.Just what I need for my businessDidn\'t like it .NiceI paid for it but it doesn\'t let me use the app just said you already own ithidden from meOk not to funTGNormaleasy and vice Brewer estimate your time reading apps right at the rate this app in your estimate for all eternity and all work included to the public learn more in your accounts and how you develop your mail and your post to LTE as much as you know what you can do is record yourself make a presentation know that your entrance and your entry is about you to always get yourself organized and involved to deliver up y...

8 thanks best invoice app on the market in my opinion.. üëç keep up the 
great work....The basic version is ok. Don't know if I would pay for the upgraded pro 
version. Wouldn't mind if it was a free trial for all the features seeing 
as u have to pay. I give 4 stars cuz support is truly awesome! That would 
make me consider paying, but still. Nt sure if it would have all the 
features in the premium package to warrant a subscription... keep up the 
great service though!The app could do with an option of changing the invoice layout and format as opposed to having one fixed invoice format.One should be able to choose/change letter font,colour,invoice format e.t.cGreat app however needs options for editing invoice amounts.User friendly!

User friendly and great for my business!
If you are looking for an app that does free invoices, makes estimates for small business and freelancers, then Invoice App-Estimate Maker is for you! As a freelancer myself I found the app very easy to navigate through and get started. Its user friendly and has everything that helps me manage my business. Such as the purchase orders and expense tracking which I find very useful to have under the documents tab, helping me stay organized. I have really saved time with the app when it comes to creating invoices, making estimates for my clients and providing quotes as well. I recommend using Invoice App it‚Äôs a great platform to use, simple and has made organizing a lot easier while allowing me scale my business with ease.

Simple but comprehensive invoicing app!
This app is great, and has way more tools than I expected from a currently free app. You can create estimates, transfer them into an invoice easily once approved, track payments, and track and bill your time! There are also reports to track who is late on payments and you can view your earnings by quarter. I always find that feature super helpful come tax time, so I‚Äôm glad this app has it! The Home Screen is easy to navigate and everything is very easy and self explanatory, which is great if you aren‚Äôt as experienced making invoices. The estimates and invoices produced look very professional. You can even add multiple businesses! If you‚Äôre looking for an invoicing app, this is the one I‚Äôd choose.

Simple, Free and Useful!
This invoice maker compiles multiple features such as setting up items, customers and services. It allows for easy editing and creation, making it so that anyone can easily manage their business. The app works well with incorporating all its features while also making it easy to save and take your information and work with you. In addition to allowing you to create an invoice, it also offers services like information and data tracking at no extra cost! This app is completely free and honestly such a great steal for any freelancer or small business owener!

Free AND easy to use?? I'll take it!
I'm just getting used to this app but it has everything readily available, including straight-forward quotes/estimates, expensing, and time-tracking - with no sign of ads.

For this to be free and so easy to use makes this a no-brainer when you need an invoice maker.

Helpful, works great
I‚Äôm using the app to enter invoices for my clients and view reports. The app is good for this purpose and easy to use. It‚Äôs easy to enter invoices and view the information that you need most. The app makes things easy for me and I recommend it.

Helpful, Favorite App
This invoice app is my favorite out of all of the ones I have tried, and it‚Äôs free! It‚Äôs very easy to use, and in my opinion it‚Äôs a lot nicer than the other apps.

Easy to use
This invoice app is easy to add edit and navigate for quick composition for clients.

Not a bot
I like the app besides the portion for ‚Äúdue date‚Äù. You can‚Äôt take it off the invoice. we get paid when the job is completed, not when the invoice is sent out. Be nice if their was an option to take off the due date.
